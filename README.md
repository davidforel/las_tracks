This script builds on another script by:  
Ryan A. Mardani, linkedin.com/in/amardani  
The reference work is:  
https://towardsdatascience.com/10-steps-in-pandas-to-process-las-file-and-plot-610732093338  
"10 Steps in Pandas to Process LAS File and Plot (Part 1)"

This script adds two extensions to the cited Mardani work:
  1. Two logs in the additional 7th track.
  2. Add a "fraction" track to the previous conventional well log display.

## Confessions

  1. This plot might have been easier with Matplotlib's "stackplot" but I could not figure out how to turn a stackplot on its side.
  2. Currently, this work is a product of Pyton 3.8 in PyCharm.
